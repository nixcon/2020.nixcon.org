          Join #nixcon on either IRC or Discord to ask questions. The rooms are bridged.
          The moderator (nbathum) will feed questions to the emcee (worldofpeace).
          <p><br>
          Folks in chat should be welcoming to everyone. If you can answer someone's question completely please do so.
          The moderator will filter questions during the Q&amp;A period.
          Good questions are relevant and meaningful for the speaker and related to the content in the talk.
          Questions which are off-topic or not within community standards will not be forwarded.
